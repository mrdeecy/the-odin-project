This is the first write up in bash following TOP 
You are not supposed to see this 
But if you did, you are indedd a curious one for that!

Now here's how I'm getting started. It follows my
brothers' interest in writing his first lines of code
And ususally that was my idea. 

He liked it and asked for resources to help him learn to code
I found them, gave it to him to learn and after a year later,,
He can use HTML and CSS like a pro. He barely acknowledges that fact.

I'm still proud of him. But the truth is I did start around covid.
With this same PC I'm typing from. And I don't know but I distracted myself
and still back to square one.

With inspiration from my young bro, I'm heading and taking this challenge head on..
Learning to code for real this time. No distractions! So I've sort to keep my promise
from a couple of friends..

Let's get going..!
