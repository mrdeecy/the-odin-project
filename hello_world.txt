This is the first write up in bash following TOP 
You are not supposed to see this 
But if you did, you are indedd a curious one for that!

Now here's how I'm getting started. It follows my
brothers' interest in writing his first lines of code
And it was a lesson I was partaking. 

He liked it and asked for resources to help him learn to code
Found them, gave it to him and a year later,
He writes HTML and CSS like a pro. He barely acknowledges that fact.

I'm still proud of him. But the truth is I did start around covid.
With this same PC I'm typing on. I don't know but I distracted myself
and still back to square one.

With inspiration from my young bro, I'm taking this challenge head on..
Learning to code for real this time. No distractions! 

So I have a promise to keep to a couple of friends to keep me accountable.

Let's get going..!
